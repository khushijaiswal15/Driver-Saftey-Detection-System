The dataset includes 3661 images.
Cellphone-in-drivers are annotated in YOLO v7 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise, upside-down
* Random rotation of between -37 and +37 degrees
* Random shear of between -33° to +33° horizontally and -15° to +15° vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random rotation of between -34 and +34 degrees
* Random shear of between -15° to +15° horizontally and -24° to +24° vertically
